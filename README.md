# ðŸ§ª Okta authentication boilerplate

This module adds Okta OAuth2 authentication and group discovery to your Silverstripe website

:warning: ðŸ§ª This module is under active development and may include breaking changes.

## Scope

With this module you can

+ Create an OAuth2 client via configuration using [bigfork/silverstripe-oauth-login](https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-oauth-login)
+ Authenticate an Okta user that may or may not be a Silverstripe member, via Okta OAuth
+ Save Okta groups returned for a user as Silverstripe group records, and link that user to them
+ Restrict Silverstripe login access to one or more configured Okta groups
+ Optionally disallow/allow the default member authenticator

### Okta API

+ Create an Okta API client using [okta/sdk](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-php)
+ Synchronise users via a queued job (via Okta API)
+ Block sign-in for those Okta users who have stopped appearing for a configured time period in synchronisation results
+ Optionally remove users who have not synchronised after a certain time.

Use of the Okta API is optional.

## You will need

+ An Okta account
+ An Okta OAuth service application configured with scopes granted
+ A valid groups claim to return some or all of the user's Okta groups
+ If you require multiple sites authenticating via Okta, a service application per site.
+ A `clientId` and `clientSecret` for Oauth
